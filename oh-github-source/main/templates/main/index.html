        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Will my data from Github be public?</b><br>
            <b>The short answer</b>: No, by connecting your account you don't agree
            to make your data public or give anyone access to this data.
            It will be stored in your Open Humans account and you decide with whom to share.<br>
            <b>The longer answer</b>: It can be public if you want it to be public.
            If you're logged in into Open Humans <a href='https://www.openhumans.org/public-data/'>
              can make individual sources publicly available
            through the public data feature</a>.
          </li>
          <li><b>Do you keep my data up to date?</b><br>
            Yes, we regularly update your data to keep it up to date.
          After logging in you can also manually trigger an update.</li>
          <li><b>Who's running this project?</b><br>
            This project is run by the team of Open Humans itself.</li>
          <li><b>How can I be in touch with you?</b><br>
            You can reach us via email at support@openhumans.org
